Branch 2:

This project began by cloning a bare bones MERN project that I had created previously (see branch 01, which is a clone from here: https://github.com/StephenDoyle10/Guestbook). This project contained CRUD capabilities: users were allowed to create posts that contained a message and their name. However, in this project users will be creating posts with song lyrics, song name, artist name and their own name. The schema, resolvers and the UI were altered to reflect these changes.
